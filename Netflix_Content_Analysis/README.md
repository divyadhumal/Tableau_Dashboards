# 🎬 Netflix Content Dashboard – Tableau Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Netflix’s content library to uncover insights into:
- Movies vs TV Shows distribution

## 📊 Problem Statement
Netflix has thousands of movies and TV shows, but understanding:
- What type of content dominates?  
- Which countries contribute the most?  
- How ratings are distributed?  
- How content has evolved over the years?  

… requires clear and interactive visualizations.  

This project aims to answer these questions with a **Tableau dashboard**.

## 🔧 Tools & Skills Used
- **Tableau Desktop Public Edition** → Dashboard building  
- **Excel / CSV (Netflix Titles Dataset)** → Data source  
- **Data Cleaning** → Handled missing values, standardized ratings, formatted release years

   - **Top Directors** → Horizontal bar chart of directors with most titles  
   - **Top 10 Countries** → Bar chart of contributing countries  
   - **Releases Over Time** → Line chart showing growth in content  
   - **Rating Distribution** → Bar chart of content maturity ratings  
   - **Content by Country** → Tree map for geographical distribution  
   - **Duration Analysis** → Heatmap of short/long content
