**🏏 IPL Analysis Dashboard (2008–2020)**

*📌 Business Problem*

The Indian Premier League (IPL) generates a huge amount of data every season — match results, player statistics, team performances, and more.
However, this data is often scattered across multiple sources, making it hard for fans, analysts, and team strategists to explore trends, compare seasons, and evaluate player performance in one place.

There was a need for an interactive, all-in-one dashboard that allows users to explore IPL data over multiple seasons and uncover actionable insights.
 
 *💡 Solution Approach*

To address this, I created an Interactive Tableau Dashboard that covers IPL data from 2008 to 2020 with the following features:

📅 Season Filter – Instantly explore any IPL season.  
🏆 Title Winners – View champions for each year.  
🏏 Orange Cap & Purple Cap Holders – Top batsman and bowler for every season.  
💥 Boundary Insights – Total 4’s and 6’s for each tournament.  
🎯 Toss Decision Impact – Win percentage when batting or fielding first.  
📊 Visual Storytelling – Clean, interactive charts for easy understanding.
